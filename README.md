# Firefly

Firefly is a meditative mini game site that helps the user to relax and or focus. The mini games are pattern puzzles that the user must complete by clicking orbs of light (fireflies) which release music notes building chords that begin to resolve. After three games are completed in a day a firefly joins the user's meadow page containing its own note. The fireflies will sing when they are dragged into the users' glass jar.
